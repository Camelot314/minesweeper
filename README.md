# minesweeper
This is the first extensive java project that I have worked on. The project includes a gui that runs the minesweeper game.
In addition in the ai package is a algorithm that I made that works as a rudamentary minesweeper solver. While the solver
is running the gui goes white. Only after the solver has either lost or won will the gui update. I never really could figure
out how to get the gui to update dynamically. The ai can be turned on if you uncomment lines 52 and 53 of the Gui.java file
in the gui directory. The algorithm for the solver itself is really slow but shouldn't infinite loop (to my knowledge). Though
a lot of the early tests did have infinite loops however I think I ironed them all out.
